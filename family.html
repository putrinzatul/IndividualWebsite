            I have a mother and father who took care of me from childhood to adulthood. The head of the family is my father. My father's name is <strong><font color="#f1420e" size = "4" face = "arial"> Mohd Rashid bin Taib</font></strong> was born in <font color="#1782cc " size = "4" face = "arial">Pahang</font>.   He is the pillar of our family,
            strict at times but soft at heart. He loves to travel but doesnt like to waste time and is constantly working to make us lead a happy life. He is an ideal father. The backbone of the family is my mother. 
             My mother's name is <strong><font color="#f1420e" size = "4" face = "arial">Rosnani binti Md Yasin </font><strong> born in <font color="#1782cc" size = "4" face = "arial">Negeri Sembilan.</font>
             She is usually talkative throughout the day which makes our house full of laughter and giggles. She loves cooking, cleaning every nooks and corner of our home, and staying socially active in the society. She is my role model.
